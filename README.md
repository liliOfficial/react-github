Approach step by step:
1. Analyse requirementMain product to deliver: A green field react application with required functionFunction requirements: display content, sort by function and search functionTime limitation: about 2 hours.
2. General SolutionAs the main conflict is the time limitation and the quality of the products, I decided to realize the main functions in 2 hours, add more detail after that and submit the product in one day.
Solutions to save time:Use 'create-react-app' to create project
User 3rd party libraries including: bootstrap for responsive and style and font-awesome for iconsReuse some common component I have written before for example: input and pagination
3. Specific SolutionIn two hours:1) Draft the design of UI: Page header + Search + List of repositories (repository’s Id, name, watchers_count, programming_language and start)2) Create Application, install 3rd party libraries, struction the project (components, services and mock data),copy in reusable common components and add mock data to be used.3)  Start from main.jsx, import input component, pagination component, use mock data to show the list and use bootstrap style to display information responsively.4) Add functions: sort mock data by star, integrate pagination functions and search input functions.The application meets the requirements in two hours' time.
After two hours:1) Add a little bit more style to make the page more readable2) Moe listItem to individual component3) Install axios, add http service. Move data import from components to services, identify api endpoint and prepare for http call.4) Add replace sortByStar with sortBy function to let the user sort posiitory by Id, Star or Watch.5) Add Header component with page header and move sort by group buttons to this component6) Edit read me file
